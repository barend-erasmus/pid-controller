# PID Controller

A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three term controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.

# Proportional Controller

Proportional Controller gives an output which is proportional to the current error where the current error is calculated by subtracting the target from the current value. This type of controller is prone to overshooting the target and ends up oscillating.
